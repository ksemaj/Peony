## Recent Changes

### 🏗️ Architecture Refactor (October 27, 2025)

**Completed:** Complete code refactor with modular architecture and enforcement rules

#### What Changed
**Problem:** ContentView.swift was 2,755 lines - unmaintainable, hard to debug, poor separation of concerns

**Solution:** Extracted into 37+ modular components with clear responsibilities

**Key Improvements:**
- ContentView.swift: 2,755 → 124 lines (95% reduction)
- OnboardingView.swift: 582 → 157 lines
- ThemesCard.swift: 210 → 125 lines
- Created architecture enforcement system
- Fixed onboarding flow issues
- Repositioned UI elements per design requirements

#### New Architecture
**Created 40+ new component files:**

**Components/**
- `Plants/` (6 files): SeedView, SproutView, StemView, BudView, FlowerView, PlantView
- `Flora/` (7 files): TreeView, BushView, WildflowerView, MushroomView, RockView, GrassBladeView, DirtPathView
- `UI/Backgrounds/` (3 files): SkyBackgroundView, GardenBackgroundView, GardenPathView
- `UI/Celestial/` (2 files): SunView, MoonView
- `UI/Fauna/` (3 files): ButterfliesView, FirefliesView, BirdsView
- `UI/Toolbars/` (2 files): GardenToolbarButtons, NotificationTestButton

**Views/**
- `Garden/` (11 files): ContentView, GardenLayoutView, GardenBedView, GardenBedsView, SeedCardView, PlantedSeedView, PlantSeedView, EditSeedView, SeedDetailView, PlantingSuccessView, WateringSuccessView
- `Onboarding/` (5 files): OnboardingView, OnboardingPageView, NotificationTimePage, OnboardingTutorialView
- `Notes/` (8 files): NotesView, CreateNoteView, EditNoteView, NoteDetailView, NoteRowView, NotesStatsView, ThemesCard, ThemeChip
- `Shared/` (4 files): WateringButtonView, FullScreenImageView, MoodHelpers, FlowLayout

**Architecture Enforcement:**
- `.rules/ARCHITECTURE_RULES.md` - Modular design principles
- `.rules/check_architecture.sh` - Automated compliance checker

#### Design Philosophy
- **Single Responsibility**: Each file has one clear purpose
- **Logical Grouping**: Related components organized in intuitive directories
- **Practical File Sizes**: 400-500 lines guideline (not strict rule)
- **Working in the Right Place**: Changes happen where they logically belong
- **No Backup Files**: Clean repo, no `.bak`, `_OLD`, `_NEW` files

#### Issues Fixed
✅ **Onboarding Flow**
- "Get Started" button now properly dismisses onboarding
- Separate OnboardingView (app entry) vs OnboardingTutorialView (help button)
- Synchronous state updates prevent timing issues

✅ **UI/UX Polish**
- Toolbar buttons repositioned (notification test moved to right)
- Garden bed centered on screen
- Decorative elements (flora/fauna) hidden for cleaner design
- Custom Playfair Display font with Georgia fallback

✅ **Build Status**
- All 40+ new files integrated into Xcode project
- Zero compilation errors
- Architecture compliance: PASSED

## Architecture Enforcement

### Running Compliance Checks
```bash
./.rules/check_architecture.sh
```

### Rules Summary
1. **Root Directory**: Only PeonyApp.swift allowed
2. **File Size**: 400-500 lines guideline (violations at 800+)
3. **Logical Organization**: Changes happen where they belong
4. **No Backup Files**: No `.bak`, `_OLD`, `_NEW` suffixes
5. **No Empty Directories**: Keep structure clean

---

## Technical Details

### Refactor Stats
- **Files Created:** 40+ new modular components
- **Code Reduction:** ContentView 2,755 → 124 lines (95%)
- **Architecture Compliance:** PASSED
- **Build Status:** ✅ Zero errors

### Key Technical Wins
1. **Onboarding State Management**: Fixed by using ZStack + separate view variants
2. **Notification Feedback**: Encapsulated in NotificationTestButton component
3. **Font System**: Playfair Display with Georgia fallback
4. **Modular Toolbar**: Split into reusable button components
5. **Layout Fixes**: Garden bed positioning, toolbar visibility
