# README Maintenance Rule

**Effective:** Immediately  
**Status:** MANDATORY

## Rule: Maintain README Format Before Every Commit

Before every commit that pushes to main, verify and update the README to ensure it matches the desired clean format.

### Format Requirements

1. **Header:** Must be `# ðŸŒ¸ Peony` (with flower emoji)
2. **Keep it clean:** Maintain simple, professional tone
3. **No gamification mentions:** Focus on mindfulness and reflection
4. **Update Recent Updates:** Always document relevant fixes/changes before pushing
5. **Structure:** Keep the existing section layout (Core Concept, Core Experience, Tech Stack, App Structure, Design, Key Models, Recent Updates, Development Principles)

### What to Update

Before committing, check if the README needs updates for:
- New features added
- Recent bug fixes
- Architecture changes
- Version updates
- Any breaking changes

### What NOT to Change

- Keep the clean, minimal tone
- Maintain existing section structure
- Don't add excessive detail
- Don't clutter with file trees or excessive documentation links
- Keep it readable and professional
