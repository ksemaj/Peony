## ðŸš¨ REQUIRED: Add New Files to Xcode

The new files exist on disk but **must be added to the Xcode project** to compile.

### Quick Steps:

1. **Open `Peony.xcodeproj` in Xcode**

2. **Add Models Folder**
   - Right-click "Peony" folder in Project Navigator
   - Choose "Add Files to 'Peony'..."
   - Navigate to `/Peony/Models/`
   - Select ALL 4 files (Cmd+click):
     * JournalSeed.swift
     * GrowthStage.swift
     * ColorExtensions.swift
     * Config.swift
   - **UNCHECK** "Copy items if needed"
   - **CHECK** "Create groups"
   - Click "Add"

3. **Add ExportManager**
   - Right-click "Peony" folder
   - Choose "Add Files to 'Peony'..."
   - Navigate to `/Peony/Utilities/`
   - Select `ExportManager.swift`
   - Same settings as above
   - Click "Add"

4. **Fix Moved Files** (if needed)
   - If NotificationManager.swift shows red/missing:
     * Remove reference (right-click â†’ Delete â†’ Remove Reference)
     * Re-add from `/Peony/Utilities/NotificationManager.swift`
   - If SettingsView.swift shows red/missing:
     * Remove reference
     * Re-add from `/Peony/Views/Shared/SettingsView.swift`

5. **Build**
   - Press **Cmd+B**
   - Should build successfully!

6. **If Build Fails**
   - Clean: **Cmd+Shift+K**
   - Rebuild: **Cmd+B**
   - Still failing? Clean derived data:
     * Xcode â†’ Preferences â†’ Locations â†’ Derived Data
     * Click arrow â†’ Delete folder
     * Rebuild
