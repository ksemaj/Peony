# Phase 1: Core UX Fixes - COMPLETED ✅

## Summary

Phase 1 of the Peony AI Enhancement plan has been successfully completed. All core UX improvements have been implemented to improve user retention and engagement.

---

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Growth Timeline Adjustment (90 days)

**Changes Made:**
- Modified `JournalSeed` model to use configurable `growthDurationDays` property (default: 90 days)
- Updated `growthPercentage` calculation to support custom durations
- Changed from 365 days (1 year) to 90 days (3 months) as default
- Growth calculation now supports watering bonuses

**Impact:**
- Seeds now bloom in 90 days instead of 365 days
- Much better user retention potential
- Users can see full bloom in 3 months

**Files Modified:**
- `Peony/ContentView.swift` (lines 7-69)

---

### 2. Edit & Delete Functionality

**Changes Made:**
- Created `EditSeedView` - full-featured editor for journal entries
- Added edit button in `SeedDetailView` toolbar
- Implemented delete confirmation alert
- Delete automatically cancels scheduled notifications
- Edit preserves growth progress and planted date

**Features:**
- Edit title, content, and image
- Visual feedback with green borders on focused fields
- Form validation (title and content required)
- Beautiful garden-themed background

**Files Created:**
- `EditSeedView` component in `ContentView.swift` (lines 1620-1805)

**Files Modified:**

### 3. Watering Mechanic

**Changes Made:**
- Added `timesWatered` property to track watering count

- Shows "Already Watered Today" when on cooldown
- Displays times watered in seed stats
- Bonus can reduce bloom time from 90 to ~45 days if watered daily

**Algorithm:**
```
Base Growth: (days passed / growth duration) * 100%
Water Bonus: times_watered * 1%
Total Growth: min(base + bonus, 100%)
```
