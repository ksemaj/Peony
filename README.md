# Peony - Mindful Journaling iOS App

A beautiful iOS journaling app that combines mindfulness with gamification. Write journal entries that grow into flowers through consistent care and reflection.

**Status:** Active Development  
**Latest:** v2.6.0 - October 2024 (Sky System & Visual Enhancements)  
**Platform:** iOS 16.0+  
**Language:** Swift 5.9 / SwiftUI

---

## Core Concept

Peony transforms journaling into a garden-growing experience:

1. **Plant a Seed** - Write a journal entry (content hidden until bloom)
2. **Water Daily** - Return each day to nurture your seed
3. **Watch It Grow** - Seed → Sprout → Stem → Bud → Flower (100%)
4. **Content Revealed** - Read your full entry when the flower blooms
5. **Quick Notes** - Capture thoughts instantly in the Journal tab

### Dual Journaling Modes

- **Garden Mode**: Long-form entries with delayed gratification and growth mechanics
- **Journal Mode**: Quick capture notes with instant access and AI-powered insights

---

## Core Experience

- 5-stage plant growth with daily watering
- Streak system with growth bonuses (3, 7, 14, 30 days)
- Content locked until bloom for delayed gratification
- On-device AI using NaturalLanguage framework for mood detection, theme analysis, and smart suggestions
- Beautiful pastel design with time-aware sky (real sun/moon positions, seasonal colors)
- Custom plant animations with realistic growth stages
- Smart notifications for bloom reminders and daily check-ins
- Attach images to entries
