# Peony - Mindful Journaling iOS App

A beautiful iOS journaling app that combines mindfulness with gamification. Write journal entries that grow into flowers through consistent care and reflection.

**Status:** Active Development  
**Latest:** v2.6.0 - October 2024 (Sky System & Visual Enhancements)  
**Platform:** iOS 16.0+  
**Language:** Swift 5.9 / SwiftUI  
**Health Score:** 9.0/10

---

## Core Concept

Peony transforms journaling into a garden-growing experience:

1. **Plant a Seed** - Write a journal entry (content hidden until bloom)
2. **Water Daily** - Return each day to nurture your seed
3. **Watch It Grow** - Seed → Sprout → Stem → Bud → Flower (100%)
4. **Content Revealed** - Read your full entry when the flower blooms
5. **Quick Notes** - Capture thoughts instantly in the Journal tab

### Dual Journaling Modes

- **Garden Mode**: Long-form entries with delayed gratification and growth mechanics
- **Journal Mode**: Quick capture notes with instant access and AI-powered insights

---

## Features

### Gamification
- 5-stage plant growth (seed → flower)
- Daily watering mechanic
- Streak system with bonuses (3, 7, 14, 30 days)
- Delayed gratification (content locked until bloom)
- Growth stats and tracking

### On-Device AI (Privacy-First)
- Mood detection (Natural Language framework)
- Theme analysis (pattern recognition)
- Writing prompts (daily suggestions)
- Smart seed suggestions (converts worthy notes)
- Insights and analytics

### User Experience
- Beautiful pastel design with custom serif typography
- Dynamic time-aware sky (real sun/moon positions, seasonal colors)
- Custom plant animations with realistic growth stages
- Native iOS with SwiftUI
- Smart notifications (bloom reminders, daily check-ins)
- Attach images to entries
- Time-aware fauna (butterflies during day, fireflies at night)
